# BicubicBSpline
The aim of this assessment was to produce a program to generate and display cubic and bicubic B-splines to represent curves and surfaces respectively. All three parts of the assessment have been completed successfully. The amount of replicated code in the program could be substantially reduced by adding polymorphism to the curve and surface classes.
